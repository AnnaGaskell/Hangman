# Hangman

When a new game is started, the game will load in the dictionary and randomly select a word between 5 and 12 characters long for the secret word.


There is a display count so the player knows how many more incorrect guesses they have before the game ends. 



Every turn, allows the player to make a guess of a letter and updates the display to reflect whether the letter was correct or incorrect. If out of guesses, the player will lose.


There is a save functionality where, at the start of any turn, instead of making a guess the player also has the option to save the game. 


When the program first loads, there is an option that allows the player to open one of their saved games.
